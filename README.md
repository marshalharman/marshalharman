### Hi there 👋 
:zap: I’m Harman Marshal Singh, a software engineer and graduate of BITS Pilani, India, with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics.

🚀 Currently building [Deepdive](https://deepdive.so), an AI-powered learning platform focused on organizing and exploring knowledge through branching conversational interfaces.

💻 Previously, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, where I built scalable ML-driven pipelines and real time data platforms. 

🤖 I interned at Amazon and Flipkart as a software developer, and at PayPal as a data science intern. I was also part of BITS Pilani's first Mars Rover Team, Project Kratos.

🌱 My interests lie in machine learning systems, software engineering and human-centered AI tools.
